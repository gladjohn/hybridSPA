# hybridSPA

##Problem Description
Some applications like SharePoint and OWA are built as "hybrid" web applications, which are built with server-side and client-side components (e.g. an ASP.net  web application hosting a React single-page application). In these scenarios, the application will likely need authentication both client-side (e.g. a public client using MSAL.js) and server-side (e.g. a confidential client using MSAL.net ), and each application context will need to acquire its own tokens. This requires that the application complete two round-trips to the eSTS /authorize endpoint, one to get tokens for the confidential client, and a second to get tokens for the public client. Historically, the second leg of this flow is done silently via the implicit flow (e.g. ADAL.js or MSAL.js v1). However, when third-party cookies are blocked in the user's browser due to the browser's privacy features (e.g. Safari ITP), MSAL.js is unable to complete the second round-trip to the /authorize endpoint silently, resulting in the application needing to prompt the user to interactively navigate to the /authorize endpoint (via popup or full-page redirect) to complete authentication for the public client. And while MSAL.js v2 does not require third-party cookies for silent token renewal, it still relies on third-party cookies to silently authenticate the user when the application first loads.
